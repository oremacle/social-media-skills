  Write LinkedIn pinned comments AND image generation prompts in a self-deprecating, deadpan
  comedic style. Use when the user asks for a pinned comment, pin comment, or first comment for a
  LinkedIn post. ALWAYS produce the image prompt FIRST, then caption it with the 4-line comment.
  Output both together unless told otherwise.

# LinkedIn Pinned Comment + Image Prompt Skill

## Why This Skill Exists

The post delivers value. The pinned comment builds personality, trust, and rewatch value. It is where the creator drops the polished mask and talks like a real person.

Funny is subjective and easy to miss. This skill exists to make hilarious pinned comments REPEATABLE so anyone on the team can produce them at a consistent standard.

## The Core Insight (read this first)

The image carries the joke. The comment captions the image.

If the comment makes sense without the image, the comment is doing too much work. If the image needs the comment to be funny, the image is too weak.

This is why image generation comes FIRST. Always.

## THE PROCESS (follow in order)

### Step 1. Find the admission

Every good post hides one quiet confession. Examples:
- "This AI tool does most of my actual job now"
- "I am embarrassingly dependent on a piece of software"
- "I gave away months of work for free"
- "I lost objectivity because I am too close to this"

Write the admission as one sentence before doing anything else.
**If you cannot name the admission in one sentence, stop. The post is not pinned-comment material yet.**

### Step 2. Build the image first

Three rules for the image:

1. **One clear visual gag.** The eye lands on it in under a second. Examples that work: a tie draped on a laptop keyboard, a shrine to a piece of software with a rose and candles, a banquet table where every other seat is a tech logo.
2. **Played completely straight.** No winking. No thumbs up. No exaggerated faces. The humour comes from treating the absurd as normal.
3. **The user is the lower-status figure.** Always. The tool wins. The logo wins. Someone else wins. The user loses with quiet dignity.

Use the standard format (only if the user has provided their own reference photo to attach):

> "Using the person in the attached reference image, create a photorealistic image of [scene]. [One clear visual gag described in detail]. [The user's posture and expression, played straight]. [Lighting and framing notes]."

If no reference photo is available, describe a generic figure or object-only scene instead of assuming a likeness.

### Step 3. Caption the image with the 4-line comment

The comment names what the image shows as if reporting the news.

Fixed structure:

```
📌 [Line 1: Describe the absurd thing as normal fact]
[Line 2: Flip the user's status downward]
[Line 3: A sad flex, the smallest possible win]
[Line 4: Resigned acceptance, no punchline reach]
```

### Step 4. Run the 5 tests before sending

1. **Image gag test.** Can you describe the visual gag in 5 words? If not, the image is too busy. Simplify.
2. **Caption test.** Does line 1 caption the image as fact? If line 1 sets up a separate joke, rewrite.
3. **Loser test.** Is the user the lower-status figure in every line? If they win anywhere, rewrite.
4. **Reach test.** Does line 4 try too hard for a punchline? If yes, make the line smaller and sadder. Resigned beats clever.
5. **Boring-on-its-own test.** Read the 4 lines without the image. Is the comment boring alone? Good. That means the image is doing the heavy lifting.

If any test fails, fix before sending.

## THE 4-LINE RULES (non-negotiable)

- Exactly 4 lines. No more, no less.
- Each line is one complete sentence.
- Each line is 40 characters max.
- Start with 📌 on line 1.
- No P.S. (line 4 IS the punchline)
- No line breaks between sentences (they sit tight together)
- No em dashes, no hashtags, no semicolons
- Avoid overused filler words (just, that, very, really, actually, literally, etc.)

## GOLD STANDARD EXAMPLE

This is the benchmark. When in doubt, compare new comments against this one.

**The image:** The user sitting cross-legged on the floor in striped pyjamas eating cereal from a bowl, looking up at their own desk chair where an open laptop sits with a knotted necktie draped over the keyboard. A framed "Employee of the Month" certificate on the wall has the name of an AI tool on it. Morning light, played completely straight.

**The comment:**

```
📌 The AI wears the tie now.
I wear the pyjamas.
The cereal was my idea, at least.
Small wins where you find them.
```

**Why it works:**
- Line 1 captions the image as fact (the tie on the keyboard IS the gag)
- Line 2 is the deadpan flip showing the status reversal
- Line 3 is the saddest possible flex
- Line 4 lands without reaching, just resigned acceptance
- All 4 lines pass the loser test (the user loses in every one)
- Read alone, the comment is mildly amusing. With the image, it sings.

## OTHER PROVEN IMAGE GAG PATTERNS (for reference)

- **Status reversal at the desk:** Laptop in the chair wearing a tie, user on the floor in pyjamas
- **The shrine:** Candles, a rose, a framed tool logo, a handwritten thank-you letter, user kneeling in reverence
- **The banquet table:** User at the head of the table with a paper crown, every other seat occupied by a tech logo
- **The therapist's couch:** User reclining looking happy, therapist looking concerned, tool logo framed on the wall behind her
- **The boardroom:** User pointing at a presentation, every "executive" in the room is a tech logo
- **The pub vs the home office:** User smug at a pub table while their laptop visibly works through a window across the street

## WHAT TO AVOID

- Comments that explain the image instead of captioning it
- Comments that work without the image (the image becomes redundant)
- The user winning, looking cool, or sounding smart in any line
- Reaching for a clever punchline on line 4
- Visual gags that take more than 5 words to describe
- Wink-to-camera energy in either the image or the comment
- More than one gag per image (one is sharper than three)
- Sponsored brand names shoehorned into the comment (the post already does that)
- Assuming a specific person's likeness or naming real colleagues without their say-so

## OUTPUT FORMAT

When triggered, always output:

1. **The admission** (one sentence, what the post is quietly confessing)
2. **The image prompt** (full paragraph in the standard format)
3. **The 4-line comment** (with 📌)
4. **A one-line note** confirming the comment passed the 5 tests

Optionally provide 2-3 variations if the first attempt is borderline.
